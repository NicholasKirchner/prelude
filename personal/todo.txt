-Enable pushing of mail_config.el by eliminating personal email

-See above for gnus/start.el

-Goals for gnus-mode-setup:

Gnus mode insists on taking over a whole frame; the command to prevent
this is buggy.  Therefore, we want the following

1) The gnus frame should have a three-pane view
2) gnus-init should spawn a new frame for that view
2a) if gnus is not running, gnus-init must first start gnus
2b) if gnus is running, gnus-init should put the running gnus on a
new frame
